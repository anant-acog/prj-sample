This repository is sample repository, of how naming and everything should be in a project. belwo are the instructions


Assume that the project name is “prj”. If there no project, then internal
Docker containers will be called atk-prj-*
then run "docker build -t atk-prj-sample:latest ."
Github Projects called prj-* – the github projects are named like that.
Each github project should have a README.md.x
The heading of the README.md should be as follows:
—-
project_name: ATK System tools
short_description: System tools used for maintaining the servers
tags: [scripts, internal]
category: tech
status: active
long_description: >
  These tools are used to set up the machines, add users, and automate maintenance.
  There may be hardcoded details in here.
